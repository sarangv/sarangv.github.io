              <h1>Vagaro Internship</h1>
              <h4>June 2019 - September 2019</h4>
              <a href="https://www.vagaro.com/">Vagaro</a>
              <p>Vagaro is a startup located in Dublin,CA providing hair salon, spa, and fitness centers a platform to book appointments and carry transactions.
                In my short but impactful time at this company, I primarily worked with Microsoft Powertools (such as Powerapps, PowerBI, Flow, ) to build internal apps.
                I first worked on a project to automate their Employee Onboarding Process where I was taking the time to understand the company's software as well as 
                how Powertools were to be utilized. After completing this project with more than 5 weeks left, I was given the task to develop an Expense Reporting App which
                allowed employees to send expense reports to managers and finances, managers to approve/send back reports, and finances to send reimbursements back to employees using Xero API.
                While working at Vagaro, I was able to absorb the benefits of working at a startup. At my time here, I was able to truly see my impact on the company. With both my applications
                in use today, I am proud to have worked for this budding company. I hope to utilize my team, leadership, and technical skills gained from Vagaro.

              <h1>Minesweeper AI</h1>
              <h4>April 2020 - June 2020</h4>
              <p>Utilizing my knowledge gained from the Intro. to AI course I took, I developed a program to solve various Minesweeper boards.
                Minesweeper's objective is to clear a rectangular board containing hidden "mines" without uncovering any of them, with help from clues about the number of neighboring mines in each field.
                The AI topics used in my projet include Heuristic Problem Solving, Probability, and Predicate Logic. The first approach my program would take it 
                to use the Minimum Remaining Value Heuristic. What this meant was to find spots with a guarantee that they were not mines and uncover them first.
                Next, for those that could not guarantee it would use Predicate Logic to reason out which spots were mine and which were not. Finally, if neither of those methods
                resolved the issue, a “smart guessing” algorithm based on probability was used. This last implementation was the most crucial as a large number of Minesweeper games
                require an educated guess to be made. In the end, my solution was capable of solving 8x8 boards with 75% accuracy, and 16x16 with 60% accuracy.

              <h4>November 2019</h4>
              <p>In this project, I wanted to imitate a text editor similar to emacs or vim. After taking a GUI for a text editor, I used object oriented programming and C++ to 
                get going. The features implemented emulate how a normal text-editor would function: character insertion; up, down, left, right cursor movement; home and end cursor movement;
                new line insertion; deletion (backspace and line); and undo and redo functionalities. The end result was a full functioning text-editor with easy usability.

              <h1>Twitter Chatbot</h1>
              <h4>November 2018</h4>
              <p>Twitter is one of the most popular forms of social media. Because of this, there is a large support and developers who utilize Twitter-API. Being my first project
                utilizing APIs, I wanted to see if I could do some basic Twitter extractions. This is why I built the Twitter Chatbot. This had three functionalities. 1) Retrieve
                the least common word in a user's own timeline. 2) Extract the most common word in another user's timeline. 3) Find the number of tweets in a radius based off user's 
                inputs of zipcode and distance. The concepts tested in this project include parsing queries, manipulating lists and dictionaries, and accurately using the python-twitter modules.

              <h1>ML Kaggle Competition</h1>
              <h4>June 2020</h4>
              <p>This competition was a classwide competition for my Machine Learning & Data Mining Class. In this, my group and I were given a set of training data
                and had to come up with an ML model for the testing data. This project thoroughly summed up all our findings from the class and had a very straightforward
                usecase. My group's plan was to each come up with a model and after we have optimized each, and then "stack" the models. The models used were bagging 
                (Random Forest) and boosting models (AdaBoost and Gradient Boost). The reason we chose both bagging and boosting was to decrease our final method's bias and variance since
                each model specializes in one. To optimize each model, we ran a 3 fold cross validation manipulating each parameter. We combined the models by utilizing a weighted mean
                which consisted of a bagging weight of 60% and a boosting weight of 40%. In the end, this led us to obtain a 79.903% accuracy for the testing data, one of the top five in the class.
                This project allowed me to soak in the brainstorming and implementation process that takes place to perfectly optimize a model and gave me a glimpse of how a scenario would be in 
                the real world.
